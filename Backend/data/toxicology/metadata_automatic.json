{"atom": {"description": "The dataset titled \"atom\" contains information about different molecules and their corresponding elements. It includes two columns: \"molecule_id\" and \"element.\" The data reveals that the molecule identified as \"TR000\" is associated with two elements: chlorine (Cl) and carbon (C). This concise representation highlights the elemental composition of the specified molecule, which may be useful for studies in chemistry and molecular biology.", "tags": ["molecule", "chemical elements", "data entries", "molecule identification", "element types", "chemical data", "atom information"], "min_year": "nan", "max_year": "nan"},
  "bond": {"description": "The dataset titled \"bond\" contains information about molecular bonds, specifically focusing on the bond types associated with different molecules. It includes two columns: \"molecule_id\" and \"bond_type.\" Both entries in the dataset refer to the same molecule ID, \"TR000,\" and indicate a bond type represented by a hyphen. This suggests that the dataset may be highlighting a specific characteristic or absence of a bond type for the molecule in question.", "tags": ["molecule", "bond", "chemical", "data", "structure", "research", "analysis"], "min_year": "nan", "max_year": "nan"},
  "connected": {"description": "The dataset titled \"connected\" contains information about atomic connections represented by two columns: \"atom_id2\" and \"bond_id.\" The \"atom_id2\" column lists identifiers for atoms, while the \"bond_id\" column specifies the corresponding bond identifiers that connect these atoms. The data includes two entries, indicating relationships between different atoms and their respective bonds. This dataset is useful for analyzing molecular structures and understanding the connectivity between atoms in a given system.", "tags": ["connected", "atom", "bond", "chemical", "molecular", "data", "relationships"], "min_year": "nan", "max_year": "nan"},
  "molecule": {"description": "The dataset titled \"molecule\" contains a single column labeled \"label.\" This column includes two entries, both of which are the string '+\\n'. The data appears to represent a simple binary or categorical classification, but the specific context or application of these labels is not provided. Overall, the dataset is minimal and may require additional information for a comprehensive understanding of its purpose.", "tags": ["molecule", "chemical structure", "data type: label", "binary classification", "positive values", "experimental data", "nan"], "min_year": "nan", "max_year": "nan"}}
