atom:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/atom
  columns:
  - atom_id: Data consists of text entries with a specific format 'TR###_##', where
      '###' represents a three-digit number and '##' represents a two-digit number.
      Each entry includes an 'atom_id' which is a unique identifier for atoms.
  - molecule_id: String values representing codes for molecule identification, where
      'molecule_id' indicates the specific molecule and 'text' provides commonsense
      evidence about the atom's relation to the molecule.
  - element: Single character strings representing chemical elements in toxicology.
bond:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/bond
  columns:
  - bond_id: This data consists of text entries formatted as 'TRXXX_X_X', where 'TRXXX'
      indicates a specific molecule and 'A1' and 'A2' represent specific atoms within
      that molecule. Each entry includes a unique bond_id for identification.
  - molecule_id: String values representing codes for molecules, specifically identifying
      the molecule in which a bond appears.
  - bond_type: A string representing the type of bond, with specific symbols indicating
      single, double, or triple bonds.
connected:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/connected
  columns:
  - atom_id: Text data in the format TR###_##, containing atom_id, atom id, id of
      the first atom, and text.
  - atom_id2: Text data in the format TR###_# representing atom identifiers and associated
      text information.
  - bond_id: Text data representing bond information between two atoms, formatted
      as TR###_#_# where '###' is a numeric identifier and '#' represents additional
      identifiers.
molecule:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/molecule
  columns:
  - molecule_id: Text data in the format TR### representing unique identifiers for
      molecules, indicating whether each molecule/compound is carcinogenic or not.
  - label: A text data type containing string values that represent symbols indicating
      whether a molecule is carcinogenic or not.
