atom:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/atom
  columns:
  - atom_id: Unique identifier for atoms, represented as a text string.
  - molecule_id: Text identifier for a molecule's atom in the format TRXXX_i, where
      TRXXX is the molecule ID (text) and i is the atom index (integer).
  - element: 'Text data listing chemical elements relevant to toxicology, formatted
      as a list with symbols followed by names (e.g., ''cl: chlorine'').'
  description: 'The dataset titled "atom" contains information about molecules and
    their associated elements. It includes two columns: "molecule_id," which identifies
    the molecule, and "element," which specifies the chemical element present. The
    data consists of two entries, both linked to the molecule ID "TR000," with elements
    "cl" (chlorine) and "c" (carbon).'
bond:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/bond
  columns:
  - bond_id: bond_id
  - molecule_id: molecule_id
  - bond_type: bond_type
  description: 'The dataset titled \"bond\" contains information about molecular bonds, specifically focusing on the bond types associated with different molecules. It includes two columns: \"molecule_id\" and \"bond_type.\" Both entries in the dataset refer to the same molecule ID, \"TR000,\" and indicate a bond type represented by a hyphen. This suggests that the dataset may be highlighting a specific characteristic or absence of a bond type for the molecule in question.'
connected:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/connected
  columns:
  - atom_id: atom_id
  - atom_id2: atom_id2
  - bond_id: bond_id
  description: "The dataset titled \"connected\" contains information about atomic connections represented by two columns: \"atom_id2\" and \"bond_id.\" The \"atom_id2\" column lists identifiers for atoms, while the \"bond_id\" column specifies the corresponding bond identifiers that connect these atoms. The data includes two entries, indicating relationships between different atoms and their respective bonds. This dataset is useful for analyzing molecular structures and understanding the connectivity between atoms in a given system."
molecule:
  base_api: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/toxicology/molecule
  columns:
  - molecule_id: molecule_id
  - label: label
  description: "The dataset titled \"molecule\" contains a single column labeled \"label.\" This column includes two entries, both of which are the string '+\\n'. The data appears to represent a simple binary or categorical classification, but the specific context or application of these labels is not provided. Overall, the dataset is minimal and may require additional information for a comprehensive understanding of its purpose."
