{"Examination": {"description": "The dataset titled \"Examination\" contains medical examination results from two patients, detailing various laboratory tests and diagnoses. Each entry includes the examination date, levels of aCL IgG, aCL IgM, and aCL IgA, as well as the presence of ANA and its pattern, along with the diagnosis, KCT, RVVT, LAC, symptoms, and thrombosis status. The first row represents the column headers, while the subsequent rows provide specific values for each patient, indicating conditions such as Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). This data is valuable for understanding autoimmune disorders and their associated laboratory findings.", "tags": ["Immunology", "Autoantibodies", "Thrombosis", "Diagnosis", "Clinical Symptoms", "Time Series", "Examination Data"], "min_year": "1992", "max_year": "1997"},
  "Laboratory": {"description": "The dataset titled \"Laboratory\" contains laboratory test results recorded on two specific dates: September 11, 1991, and September 17, 1991. It includes a variety of biochemical markers such as GOT, GPT, LDH, ALP, and others, which are essential for assessing liver function, kidney function, and overall metabolic health. Additionally, the dataset features hematological parameters like WBC, RBC, HGB, and PLT, which provide insights into the patient's blood composition. Some values are marked as 'nan', indicating missing data for certain tests. Overall, this dataset serves as a historical reference for clinical laboratory results from the early 1990s.", "tags": ["Laboratory Data", "Biochemical Markers", "Hematology", "Clinical Chemistry", "Time Series", "Health Metrics", "Patient Data"], "min_year": "1991", "max_year": "1991"},
