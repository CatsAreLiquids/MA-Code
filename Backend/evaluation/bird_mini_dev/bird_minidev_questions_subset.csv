1. **Sigma Bond (σ bond)**: This is the first bond formed between two atoms. It is created by the head-on overlap of atomic orbitals, allowing for the sharing of two electrons.

2. **Pi Bond (π bond)**: This is the second bond in a double bond, formed by the side-to-side overlap of p orbitals. The pi bond allows for additional sharing of electrons, which contributes to the strength and stability of the double bond.
