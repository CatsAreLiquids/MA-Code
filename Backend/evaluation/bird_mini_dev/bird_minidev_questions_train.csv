This dataset contains specific information about schools within Alameda County, California, including key metrics such as enrollment figures and percentages of students eligible for free meals (FRPM) for K-12 students. Since your query specifically asks for the percentage of students eligible for free meals in a school administered by an administrator named Alusine, this dataset is likely to have the relevant data. 

However, it is important to note that while the ""frpm"" dataset provides information on free meal eligibility, it may not directly include the names of administrators or district codes.

In summary, the ""frpm"" dataset is the most relevant for the percentage of eligible free meals, while the second dataset may help you find the district code and administrator's name."
