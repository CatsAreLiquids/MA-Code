**Reasoning:**
- The ""gasstations"" dataset contains information about gas stations in the Czech Republic, including their Chain ID and Segment. While it specifically mentions two segments (""Value for money"" and ""Premium""), it does not explicitly mention ""discount"" gas stations. However, the ""Value for money"" category could potentially align with the concept of discount gas stations.
- To answer the query, we would need to compare the number of ""discount"" gas stations in the Czech Republic with those in Slovakia. Since the dataset only provides information about gas stations in the Czech Republic, it would be necessary to supplement this data with additional information about gas stations in Slovakia, which is not provided in the available datasets.
- Therefore, while the ""gasstations"" dataset is relevant for the Czech Republic, additional data on gas stations in Slovakia would be required to fully answer the query.
