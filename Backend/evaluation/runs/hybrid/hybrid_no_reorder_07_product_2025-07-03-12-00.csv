1. **Dataset: ""atom""**
   - **Reason**: This dataset contains information about different molecules and their corresponding elements, specifically linking molecule IDs to their elemental composition. Although the dataset mentions the molecule ID ""TR000,"" it is likely that the structure and format of the dataset can be used to find similar information for ""TR004_8_9"" if it exists in the same context. You would need to check if ""TR004_8_9"" is included in this dataset to find the relevant elements.

2. **Dataset: ""bond""**
   - **Reason**: While this dataset specifically focuses on bond types associated with different molecules, it may provide insights into the types of bonds present in the molecule ""TR004_8_9."" Understanding the bond types can help infer the types of elements involved, especially if you can cross-reference with the ""atom"" dataset.

3. **Dataset: ""connected""**
   - **Reason**: This dataset provides information about atomic connections and bond identifiers. If ""TR004_8_9"" is represented in this dataset, it can help identify which atoms are connected by the bonds, and subsequently, you can use the ""atom"" dataset to find the elements associated with those atoms.
