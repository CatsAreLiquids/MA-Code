**Reasoning:**
- The ""Laboratory"" dataset contains laboratory test results, including biochemical markers such as GPT (Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase) and ALB (Albumin). 
- Although the dataset only includes results from two specific dates (September 11, 1991, and September 17, 1991), it provides the necessary biochemical markers to assess the conditions you are interested in (GPT levels greater than 30 and ALB levels less than 4).
- However, it is important to note that the dataset does not cover the full date range specified in your query (1987/7/6 to 1996/1/31), which may limit its applicability for a comprehensive analysis over that time frame.

Unfortunately, the other datasets do not contain the specific biochemical markers or the relevant examination dates needed to answer your query. Therefore, while the ""Laboratory"" dataset is the best fit, it may not fully satisfy the date range requirement.","['The dataset titled ""Laboratory"" contains laboratory test results recorded on two specific dates: September 11, 1991, and September 17, 1991.
