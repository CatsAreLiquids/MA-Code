**Reason:** 
The ""Income"" dataset contains financial transaction records that include a column for the date received, which specifically tracks dues payments. Although the dataset does not explicitly mention Connor Hilton, it does provide information on dues received on specific dates. If Connor Hilton is linked to a member in the dataset (as indicated by the link_to_member column), it could potentially provide the date of payment.
