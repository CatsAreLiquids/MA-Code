**Description**: The function `returnResult` aims to filter and extract specific columns from a dataset based on the provided criteria. It allows users to specify which columns they want to retrieve, streamlining data manipulation and analysis. This function can be utilized to return finished products by specifying the relevant columns in the dataset.","['function name: count:\n The function `count` aims to count the occurrences of a specified value within a designated column of a DataFrame, optionally grouping the results by another column. It processes a filter dictionary to determine the column and value to count, and returns a DataFrame with the count results.\n', 'function name: mean:\n The function `mean` calculates the mean of specified columns in a DataFrame, optionally grouping the data by specified columns. It takes a DataFrame and a filter dictionary as parameters to determine the grouping and the columns for which the mean should be computed.\n', 'function name: min:\n The function `getMin` retrieves the minimum values from a specified list of columns in a DataFrame, returning either a specified number of rows with the smallest values or a single minimum value along with its index.
