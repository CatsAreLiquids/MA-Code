The most fitting function is **count** as it directly addresses the need to count the occurrences of ""discount"" gas stations in the specified countries.","[""function name:min\nbase_api: http://127.0.0.1:5200/min\ndescription: Retrieves the maximum value for a list of specified columns in a dataframe\nreturn_type: single value\nfilter_dict: [{'columns': 'a list of columns for which the minimum should be retrieved'}, {'rows': 'number of rows to be returned'}]\n"", ""function name:mean\nbase_api: http://127.0.0.1:5200/sum\ndescription: Calcuates the mean of a dataframe based on a list of group_by columns and\nfilter_dict: [{'group_by': 'a list of coulmns in the dataframe, can be None'}, {'columns': 'a list of columns for hicht the mean should be calculated, cant be None'}]\n"", ""function name:sum\nbase_api: http://127.0.0.1:5200/sum\ndescription: Calcuates the sum of a dataframe based on a list of group_by columns and\nfilter_dict: [{'group_by': 'a list of coulmns in the dataframe, can be None'}, {'columns': 'a list of columns for hicht the sum should be calculated, cant be None'}]\n"", ""function name:max\nbase_api: http://127.0.0.1:5200/max\ndescription: Retrieves the maximum value for a list of specified columns in a dataframe\nreturn_type: single value\nfilter_dict: [{'columns': 'a list of columns for which the maximum should be retrieved'}, {'rows': 'number of rows to be returned'}]\n"", ""function name:count\nbase_api: http://127.0.0.1:5200/count\ndescription: counts the occurences of a specific value or values\nfilter_dict: [{'columns': 'a column in which the value to count is present'}, {'value': 'the value to count '}]\n"", ""function name:combine\ndescription: combines to data products via a join\nfilter_dict: [{'columns_left': 'which columns of the first data product to match on'}, {'columns_right': 'which columns of the second data product to match on'}, {'type': 'equal or unequal'}]\n"", ""function name:returnResult\ndescription: retrieves or extracts  the previously computed data, specified  by the columns in a dataframe\nfilter_dict: [{'columns': 'which columns to retrun/extract'}]\n""]",0.0204081632653061,0.1428571428571428,1.0,0.25,1,1.0
