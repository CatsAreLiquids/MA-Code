**Description**: The mean function calculates the average values of specified columns in a DataFrame, optionally grouping the data by one or more columns. It takes a filter dictionary to determine which columns to group by and which columns to compute the mean for, making it suitable for computing the average number of test takers from filtered data.","['function name: mean:\n The function mean calculates the average values of specified columns in a DataFrame, optionally grouping the data by one or more columns.
