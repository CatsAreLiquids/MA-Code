**Description**: The mean function calculates the average values of specified columns in a DataFrame, optionally grouping the data by one or more columns. In this case, it would compute the average number of test takers from Fresno schools, filtering the data to include only those schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980.","['function name: mean:\n The function mean calculates the average values of specified columns in a DataFrame, optionally grouping the data by one or more columns.
