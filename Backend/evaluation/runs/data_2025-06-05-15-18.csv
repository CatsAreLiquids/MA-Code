   - **Why it fits**: This dataset provides greenhouse gas emissions data categorized by sector and country from 1970 to 2023. It allows for analysis of emissions trends over time, which can help identify whether emissions are decreasing in specific sectors and regions. Although it does not explicitly mention GWP_100_AR5, it provides relevant emissions data that can be analyzed in the context of global warming potential.

2. **GHG_totals_by_country**:
   - **Why it fits**: This dataset offers a comprehensive view of greenhouse gas emissions for various countries over time. It can be used to analyze overall trends in emissions, including whether there is a decrease in emissions at the country level, which can be further broken down by sector if combined with other data. This dataset is useful for understanding the broader context of GHG emissions trends.
