**Reasoning:**
- The ""Laboratory"" dataset contains laboratory test results, including biochemical markers such as GPT (Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase) and ALB (Albumin). 
- Your query specifically asks for patients examined within a certain date range (1987/7/6 to 1996/1/31) and requires specific conditions for GPT and ALB levels.
- Although the dataset does not explicitly mention patient IDs, it provides the necessary laboratory test results that can be filtered based on the specified criteria (GPT > 30 and ALB < 4).
- If patient IDs were included in the dataset, it would allow for a direct response to your query by listing the relevant patients.
