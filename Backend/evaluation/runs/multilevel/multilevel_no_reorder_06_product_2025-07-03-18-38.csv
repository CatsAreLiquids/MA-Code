If there were additional entries for 2011, this dataset would be the most appropriate for extracting display names based on account creation dates.

2. **Dataset: badges**
   - **Reason**: While this dataset focuses on teachers receiving badges, it does not provide display names or account creation dates for users in 2011. However, if there were users from 2011 who received badges, this dataset could potentially be linked to the users dataset to find their display names.

3. **Dataset: postHistory**
   - **Reason**: This dataset contains user-generated posts but does not provide account creation dates or display names for users created in 2011. It is not suitable for answering the query directly.

4. **Dataset: posts**

**Reasoning:**
- The ""card"" dataset contains information about different types of cards, including their unique display IDs and types. While it does not explicitly mention text boxes or layout characteristics, it provides a structured overview of card types and their issuance dates. 
- To answer your query regarding the proportion of cards without a text box with a normal layout, you would need to analyze the types of cards present in this dataset. If additional information about the layout characteristics of each card type were available, you could determine the proportion of cards that do not conform to the normal layout.
- However, since the dataset does not currently include layout information, you may need to supplement it with additional data that specifies the layout characteristics of each card type to fully answer your query.

Additionally, the dataset includes the OwnerUserId, which can be used to retrieve the owner's display name.

2. **Dataset: comments**
   - **Reason**: While this dataset primarily contains user feedback, it can provide insights into the perceived value of posts through user comments and scores. If the comments are linked to specific posts, they can help gauge the sentiment around those posts, although it may not directly provide the most valuable post.
